# Multimodalities for African Languages AI

## Introduction

African languages are significantly underrepresented in the AI ecosystem, resulting in limited advancements for these languages in contemporary Machine Learning models. This project aims to address this gap by developing a comprehensive benchmark dataset for African languages that includes audio recordings, text transcriptions, sentiment-classified video transcriptions, and large text data. Our goal is to build AI solutions that bridge the gap between recent advancements and low-resource languages, ultimately enhancing the accessibility and utility of large language models (LLMs) for African populations.

## Research Plan

Our research plan involves:

1. **Data Collection and Model Development:**
   - Collecting data across three modalities: audio, text, and video.
   - Building and refining Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, large language models (LLMs), and video-based sentiment analysis models for various African languages.
   - Continuously improving the dataset and models, with a focus on making them publicly available.

2. **Speech-to-Text Transcription:**
   - Developing robust ASR systems for African languages, starting with Amharic and expanding to other languages such as Tigrinya, Afaan Oromoo, Swahili, Wolof, Somali, Fulani, Yoruba, Hausa, and Lingala.

3. **Large-Language-Model:**
   - Creating and fine-tuning LLMs using collected text data to enhance performance across African languages.

4. **Video-Based Emotion Model:**
   - Implementing a model to analyze video data for sentiment classification.

## Evaluation Plan

We will evaluate our progress using the following approach:

1. **Dataset Split:**
   - Divide the dataset into Training, Evaluation, and Testing sections.
   - Reserve 5-10% of the dataset for evaluation purposes.

2. **Evaluation Procedures:**
   - Use evaluation datasets during training and after completing experiments to assess performance.

## Broader Impact

This project will significantly advance machine learning solutions for African languages by:

1. **Providing High-Quality Resources:**
   - Offering a publicly accessible benchmark dataset that includes diverse modalities and is crucial for developing and training AI models for African languages.

2. **Empowering Researchers:**
   - Allowing African researchers and practitioners to access and utilize high-quality data for research and innovation.

3. **Fostering Open-Source Collaboration:**
   - Promoting open-source contributions and accelerating the development of AI solutions for African languages.

4. **Catalyzing AI Development:**
   - Enhancing the availability of AI tools and contributing to the growth of datasets for African languages.

## Potential Risks

Several risks are associated with our project:

1. **Data Access Restrictions:**
   - Some websites may restrict data usage even if it is publicly accessible.

2. **Data Quality:**
   - Potential mistakes in labeling and data collection will be mitigated with evaluation methods.

3. **Fairness and Coverage:**
   - Ensuring comprehensive coverage of African languages while prioritizing widely spoken ones and involving native speakers.

4. **Technical and Legal Challenges:**
   - Addressing legal restrictions and technical hurdles in data collection, web scraping, and maintenance.

5. **Sustainability:**
   - Planning for long-term maintenance and updates through partnerships or funding.
